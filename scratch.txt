usage:

$ ./3700send <recv_host> <recv_port>

recv_host (Required) The domain name (e.g., “foo.com”) or IP address (e.g., “1.2.3.4”) of the remote host
recv_port (Required) The UDP port of the remote host.

our 3700send script 
-opens a UDP socket
-sends packets to the given IP address on the given port.
-the packet data is supplied in STDIN. 
 - assume that the 3700recv program is running on the remote host/port
-any printing is done thru stderr


usage:

$ ./3700recv
-on startup, the receiver must bind to a UDP port
  - first thing that it prints out to STDERR must be the message: Bound to port <port>
-prints out the data that it receives, and only the data it receives, from the sender to STDOUT


exiting:

- 3700send should exit once it knows its data has been succesffuly delivered
- 3700recv should not exit on its own volition. sim will kill it


test using

$ ./run <config-file>



gracefully handle errors:
- never print out incorrect data
- will encounter 
  - lost packets, duplicate packets, corrupted packets, delayed packets
  - high and low bandwidth, high and low latency, high and low jitter
